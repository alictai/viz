Plan for Vis final project

1. FIELDS OF OUR CMV
    - Word cloud of words used to describe music based on age range
        * Maybe problematic w/ jumping around
        * Try bubble chart if word cloud == failure
    - Some graph depicting that age range's answers to the 20Q's
        * X-axis represent age range highlighted. Increment by tens?
            ^ If range = 20-30, then 2 entries/20-50, then 4 entries?
            ^ Cool transitions (bars flying away, growing) when range changes
        * How do we represent it?
            ^ Stacked bar
            ^ Overlapping line
