a. As you draw a selection rectangle that starts across the top of a cell and 
gets dragged down to capture every point from top to bottom, what happens 
within the same row? Column?

	ROW: It also captures every point from top to bottom. This is because the
	Y values are the same across a row.
	COLUMN: It also captures each point that has the corresponding x value. 

b. How about drawing the rectangle from left to right: within the same row? 
Column?

	a but flipped.

c. Use one of the class plots to highlight all the points with the same class. 
Notice one point that isnâ€™t as beautifully grouped with its class as the 
rest. Which dimension seems to be causing this distinction? Any ideas for 
how you might have figured that out without this handy visualization (no 
one correct answer)?

	Sepal width seems to be causing this distinction. You can figure this out using the rectangle highlighting and looking in what graphs it is an outlier.
